    <h1>What is tennis?</h1>
    <p>
        Tennis is a racket sport that is played against a single opponent (singles) or between
        two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a racket strung with a cord
        to strike a hollow rubber ball covered in felt over or around a net and into
        the opponent's court.
